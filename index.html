  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>Hello Everyone, <br/>
    My name is Luis R. Rosado, and I'm a Sr. Sales Engineer for the Telecom industry by day. Any other chance I get, I spend playing guitar, riding my bicycle, or tending to my two granddaughters. My youngest granddaughter loves the Australian cartoon Bluey. She watches it so much that she speaks with an Australian accent, even though she was born and raised in the US Pacific Northwest region.</p>
